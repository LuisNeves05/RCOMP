RCOMP 2020-2021 Project - Sprint 3 review
=========================================
### Sprint master: 1121224 ###
(This file is to be created/edited by the sprint master only)

# 1. Sprint's backlog #
* T.3.1-Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the
  previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for
  building 1.


* T.3.2-Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the
  previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for
  building 2.
  Final integration of each member’s Packet Tracer simulation into a
  single simulation.


* T.3.3-Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the
  previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for
  building 3.



* T.3.4-Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the
  previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for
  building 4.
# 2. Subtasks assessment #
One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

* Totally implemented with no issues 3
* Totally implemented with issues 2
* Partially implemented with no issues 1
* Partially implemented with issues 0

## Comments ##

* Due to the amount of work the group had in the couple weeks the sprint lasted, we weren´t able to implement the ACL in a fashion that
we found had good enough quality to be in the project.
  
    Therefore, ACL was not implemented .
