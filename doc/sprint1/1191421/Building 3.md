## Floor inventory

>#####For every length of cable calculated, it was taken into account the correct scale and necessary cable lenght inside telecomunication enclosures.


* ####Copper Cabble (T-568A)
>650 meters for the rest of the rooms on the ground floor
> #####13 950 meters total
* ####Fibre Cable
>Taking into consideration the redundacy needed to ensure safety and continuous signal to the building itself, twice the amount of fibre cable will be requested. 
>
>As so, to make every connection and keep them redundant, **190 meters** of fibre cable will be necessary.
* ####Floor Trunking
>This type of trunking should be rounded, to prevent accidents in the various rooms it is placed in.
>
>#####130 meters
* ####Dropped Ceiling Trunking
>On the contrary of the floor trunking, this can be a type of trunking to the client's choice, as it is going to remain hiden.
>
>#####50 meters
* ####Vertical Trunking
>Again, this type of trunking is to the client's taste, as it is meant to stay on the wall and should not cause much trouble.
>
>#####10 meters
* ####Access points
>The access points will be responsible for providing wireless internet coverage of the entire floor.
>
>The type of access point used provides a reach of 50 meters around it, as so, only 2 were necessary to cover the building. 
>However, it would be advised (for a stronger connection ground wide) to use more AP's with smaller but stronger connection power.
>
>#####2 Access Points
* ####Outlets
>Following the industry standards, for the big room on the right, the client will need 310 outlets.
>
>For the rest of the rooms on the ground floor the client will need to purchase 44 outlets for user use and one more for the Access Point.
>#####355 Outlets in total
* ####Telecomunication Enclosures
>For this floor, there will be 3 telecomunication enclosures.
>
>There are 2 Telecomunication Enclosures in room 30.5.
>
> **Number 1** will hold 4 devices (4 24 patch panels for the IC and HC's), so, it's size will be 6 * 4 U (S) = **24U**.
>
>**Number 2** will hold 7 devices (7 48 patch panels for the CP's), it's size will be 6 * 14 (patch panels with 48 entrances ocupy 2U) = **84U**.
>
>There is also a telecomunication enclosure in room 30.2, this one holds a single CP with a 48 patch panel.
>So it's size is 6 * 2 U = **12U**
>
>#####To sum up, 
>#####TE #1 -> 24U
>#####TE #2 -> 84U
>#####TE #3 -> 12U

 ## Floor inventory

* ####Copper Cabble (T-568A)
>For all the rooms in the first floor.
> #####600 meters total
* ####Fibre Cable
>Taking into consideration the redundacy needed to ensure safety and continuous signal to the building itself, twice the amount of fibre cable will be requested. 
>
>As so, to make every connection and keep them redundant, **40 meters** of fibre cable will be necessary.
* ####Floor Trunking
>This type of trunking should be rounded, to prevent accidents in the various rooms it is placed in.
>
>#####150 meters
* ####Dropped Ceiling Trunking
>On the contrary of the floor trunking, this can be a type of trunking to the client's choice, as it is going to remain hiden.
>
>#####40 meters
* ####Vertical Trunking
>Again, this type of trunking is to the client's taste, as it is meant to stay on the wall and should not cause much trouble.
>
>#####12,5 meters
* ####Access points
>The access points will be responsible for providing wireless internet coverage of the entire floor.
>
>The type of access point used provides a reach of 50 meters around it, as so, only 1 was necessary to cover the building. 
>However, it would be advised (for a stronger connection ground wide) to use more AP's with smaller but stronger connection power.
>
>#####1 Access Point
* ####Outlets
>Following the industry standards, for this floor 60 outlets are required, being that one of them is for the Access Point.
>#####60 Outlets in total
* ####Telecomunication Enclosures
>For this floor, there will be 2 telecomunication enclosures.
>
> **Number 1** (Room 31.4) will hold 2 devices (1 24 patch panel for the HC and 1 48 patch panel for the CP), so, it's size will be 6 * 3U (S) = **18U**.
>
>**Number 2** (Room 31.2) will hold 1 device (1 48 patch panels for the CP), it's size will be 6 * 2U (48 patch panels ocuppy 2U) = **12U**.
>
>#####To sum up, 
>#####TE #1 -> 18U
>#####TE #2 -> 12U
