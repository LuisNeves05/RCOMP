# Floor inventory

>#####For every length of cable calculated, it was taken into account the correct scale and necessary cable lenght inside telecomunication enclosures.


* ####Copper Cabble (T-568A)
>30000 for the big room on the right.
>
>320 meters for the rest of the rooms on the ground floor
> #####30320 meters total
* ####Fibre Cable
>Taking into consideration the redundacy needed to ensure safety and continuous signal to the building itself, twice the amount of fibre cable will be requested.
>
>As so, to make every connection and keep them redundant, **152 meters** of fibre cable will be necessary.
* ####Floor Trunking
>This type of trunking should be rounded, to prevent accidents in the various rooms it is placed in.
>
>#####130 meters
* ####Dropped Ceiling Trunking
>On the contrary of the floor trunking, this can be a type of trunking to the client's choice, as it is going to remain hiden.
>
>#####50 meters
* ####Vertical Trunking
>Again, this type of trunking is to the client's taste, as it is meant to stay on the wall and should not cause much trouble.
>
>#####10 meters
* ####Access points
>The access points will be responsible for providing wireless internet coverage of the entire floor.
>
>The type of access point used provides a reach of 50 meters around it, as so, only 2 were necessary to cover the building.
>However, it would be advised (for a stronger connection ground wide) to use more AP's with smaller but stronger connection power.
>
>#####Total = 2 Access Points
* ####Outlets
>Following the industry standards, for the big room on the right, the client will need 310 outlets.
>
>For the rest of the rooms on the ground floor the client will need to purchase 44 outlets for user use and one more for the Access Point.
>#####407 Outlets in total
* ####Telecomunication Enclosures
>For this floor, there will be 3 telecomunication enclosures.
>
>There are 2 Telecomunication Enclosures in room 30.5.
>
> **Number 1** will hold 10 devices (3 24 patch panels for the IC and some HC's and 7 48 patch panels for the CP's and one HC), so, it's size will be 6 * 17 U (S) = **102U**.
>
> **Number 2** will hold 1 device (1 24 patch panel for the CP), it's size will be 6 * 1 = **6U**.
>
> **Number 3** will hold 1 device (1 24 patch panel for the CP), it's size will be 6 * 1 = **6U**.
