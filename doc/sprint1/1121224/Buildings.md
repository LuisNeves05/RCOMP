###To sum up and explain every connection and decision made, 
This floor is made up of 1Mc,1 IC, 1 HC and 3 CP's.
The CP on the room 11.4 had to support more than 24 cables, so it was decided a 48 patch panel was better to accomodate the needs of the room.
The acess point was placed in a spot where the whole floor will have a good coverage via Wi-Fi connection. 
Every fiber connection was made using redundancy to ensure good connection.

###To sum up and explain every connection and decision made,
This floor is only requires outlets in some of the rooms, so its easy to route. smaller.Room 20.2 contains the IC, HC and a CP, which means it powers the entire floor. There are 2 Access Points, to provide full Wi-Fi support throughout all the floor's area.
Rooms 20.3 and 20.4 are quite outlet heavy, thus a 48 cp will be provided to each room to accomodate those necessities.
For even better redundance , the HC from Room 20.2 is connected to the HC directly above.
