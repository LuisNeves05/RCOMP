=========================================
### Sprint master: 1121224 ###
(This file is to be created/edited by the sprint master only)
# 1. Sprint's backlog #
T.2.1-Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 1, and also encompassing the campus backbone.Integration of every membersâ€™ Packet Tracer simulations into a single simulation.

T.2.2-Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracersimulation for building 2, and also encompassing the campus backbone.

T.2.3-Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 3, and also encompassing the campus backbone.

T.2.4-Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 4, and also encompassing the campus backbone.
# 2. Subtasks assessment #
One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses	the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

  * Totally implemented with no issues 4
  * Totally implemented with issues 0
  * Partially implemented with no issues 0
  * Partially implemented with issues 0

* During the development phase of the Sprint , the team tackled a variety of different issues regarding device(s) configurations and correct network implementation.
 In the end, as a group, we managed to solve all of our problems to deliver what we think is a fully featured implementation.
 
For the last three cases, a text description of what has not been implemented and present issues must be added.
Unimplemented features and issues solving is assigned to the same member on the next sprint.

### 2.1 Issues not implemented in the previous sprint #

The group has managed to implement the redundancy between all devices from the same layer, which was a issue left pending from the previous sprint.

### 2.2 Problems ### 

* Switch deconfiguration after shutting down devices to create new connections between different buildings.
* Wireless IPv4 configurations are lost everytime the project is reloaded.
* Laptop connectivity to access points was hard to understand until we figured out how the physical interface worked.
